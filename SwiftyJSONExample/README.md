A simple example to get you started with Swifty.

A few points to note:

- SwiftyJSON.swift has been copied into the project - this allows us to use Swifty for JSON parsing
- countries.json is the JSON file I’m using for the example. It has also been copied in to the project for easy use

- Code
	- I save the JSON data
	- Then I parse it, first using Swift’s normal data handling
	- Then I parse it with Swifty - notice how much cleaner and more readable the Swifty code is
